% ---- Profile ----
\section{Profile}
I am a biomedical and quality engineer with a background in project management and a master’s degree in management and informatics. I translate requirements into reliable, scalable operations by aligning stakeholders, development, and service to reduce defects, lead time, and rework in regulated environments. Calm, structured, and hands-on, I lead teams toward clear plans, measurable metrics, and on-time delivery.
